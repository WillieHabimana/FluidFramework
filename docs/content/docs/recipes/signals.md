In this recipe, you'll learn how the `Signaler` DataObject is used in a Fluid application to deal with a couple user presence scenarios. The two forms of presence that are covered in this example are focus tracking and mouse tracking. This article will go over how the `Signaler` DataObject is created, how both `MouseTracker` and `FocusTracker` classes work using the `Signaler` object, and how the view uses both classes to render the presence data.
